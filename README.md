# BMI Calculator App

A simple Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator built using Flutter. This app allows users to calculate their BMI by selecting their gender, adjusting their height, weight, and age, and then clicking the "Calculate" button. The design is inspired by a modern, dark theme with vibrant accent colors.

## Features

- **Gender Selection**: Users can select their gender (Male or Female).
- **Height Adjustment**: A slider allows users to adjust their height in centimeters.
- **Weight & Age Adjustment**: Buttons allow users to increment or decrement their weight (in kg) and age (in years).
- **BMI Calculation**: Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the app computes the BMI based on the input values.
